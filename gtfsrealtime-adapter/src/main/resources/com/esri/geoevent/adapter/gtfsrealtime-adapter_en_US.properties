# Inbound Adapter Definition
ADAPTER_IN_LABEL=GTFS Realtime Inbound Adapter
ADAPTER_IN_DESC=This adapter is capable of receiving/parsing GTFS realtime feed messages including Trip Updates, Service Alerts, and Vehicle Positions.

ADAPTER_IN_URL_LABEL=GTFS Realtime Source URL
ADAPTER_IN_URL_DESC=Source URL for the GTFS Realtime data feed.
ADAPTER_IN_HTTP_HEADERS_LABEL=Headers
ADAPTER_IN_HTTP_HEADERS_DESC=HTTP headers name:value with | separator for example Accept:application/x-google-protobuf|Authorization:apikey 0123456789abcdef
ADAPTER_IN_ISTEXTFORMAT_LABEL=Is Text Format
ADAPTER_IN_ISTEXTFORMAT_DESC=Yes specifies the data is in text format instead of binary. No indicates the data is in binary format.

TRANSPORT_IN_USESCHEDULETIME_LABEL=Use Scheduled Time?
TRANSPORT_IN_USESCHEDULETIME_DESC=Yes will use a scheduled start (and optional end) time instead of a regular time interval. No will use a standard polling frequency to request data.
TRANSPORT_IN_TRIGGERINTERVAL_LABEL=Polling Frequency (in Time Unit)
TRANSPORT_IN_TRIGGERINTERVAL_DESC=The frequency (in the specified time unit) that data will be requested from Source URL.
TRANSPORT_IN_STARTTIME_LABEL=Start Time
TRANSPORT_IN_STARTTIME_DESC=Time of day to start requesting data. If the current time is before the start time, data will not be requested. If the current time is after this start time, data will be requested. Time is in 24-hour format HH:mm:ss.
TRANSPORT_IN_REPEATCOUNT_LABEL=Repeat Count
TRANSPORT_IN_REPEATCOUNT_DESC=If a start time is provided, then this is the number of times to repeat the data request.  So if data is to be requested after 12:00:00 (noon) for a repeat count of 100, then data will be requested 100 times after the current time is noon.
TRANSPORT_IN_REPEATINTERVAL_LABEL=Repeat Interval (in Time Unit)
TRANSPORT_IN_REPEATINTERVAL_DESC=If a start time is provided, then this is the time interval between repeated data requests (in the specified Time Unit). So if data is to be requested after 12:00:00 (noon) for a repeat count of 480 at a Repeat Interval of 60 seconds, then data will be requested ever 60 seconds 480 times after the current time is noon (this will be 8 hours of data at 1 minute intervals).
TRANSPORT_IN_USEENDTIME_LABEL=Use End Time
TRANSPORT_IN_USEENDTIME_DESC=Yes will use an end time instead of a Repeat Count.  Data will be requested at the specified Repeat Interval until the current time is after the end time. No will use the Repeat Count to determine when to stop requesting data.
TRANSPORT_IN_ENDTIME_LABEL=End Time
TRANSPORT_IN_ENDTIME_DESC=Time of day to stop requesting data. If the current time is after the end time, data will not be requested. If the current time is before this end time, data will be requested. Time is in 24-hour format HH:mm:ss.
TRANSPORT_IN_TIMEUNIT_LABEL=Time Unit
TRANSPORT_IN_TIMEUNIT_DESC=Time unit to be used for all frequency/intervals.

# Connector Definition

CONNECTOR_DESC=Connects to an external GTFS Realtime data feed and polls Protocol Buffer formatted messages including Trip Updates, Service Alerts, and Vehicle Positions.

# Log Messages
TRANSLATION_ERROR=An unexpected error has occurred while translating a GTFS realtime message. Error: {0}.
